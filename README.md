# Comcraft Mod Loader

This is a project for allowing mods to load into [comcraft](http://www.comcraft-game.blogspot.com) - a Minecraft inspired game for J2ME devices.

Comcraft Mod Loader is not finished yet, if you have any suggestions, ideas code tips etc please make an 'issue' or a pull request.

The Commit e71872501d 'Fixed ALL [Warnings] by eclipse's quick-fix tool' deleted a large chunk of code because it was obsolete/not used but I am keeping track of queader upstream, so if any unused code becomes functional i'll change this accordingly.

This project was forked from the [Comcraft repository](https://github.com/queader/Comcraft)

Comcraft is made by queader (Piotr Wójcik), you can find him:
